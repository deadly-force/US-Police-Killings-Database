of the two officers at Hicks' door immediately grabbed the barrel of the gun and pushed it away from his partner, police say.\nThe shooting at his apartment door in Northside was the third involving Cincinnati police so far this year.\nThe more immediate concern for officers responding to Hicks' apartment was calming neighbors who were concerned, and in some cases angry, about what happened and why.\nBlackwell said the officers knocked on the door and identified themselves as police officers.","url":"http:\/\/www.cincinnati.com\/story\/news\/crime\/2015\/06\/09\/officer-involved-shooting-northside\/28778129"}]},{"id":6916,"date":"2015-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","shots_fired":null,"description":null,"auto_summary":"On

Police say the boy was told to drop what he was holding and did not. He reached to his waistband and was then shot outside of the rec center. He was shot in the abdomen and taken to MetroHealth Medical Center with serious injuries. After surgery was performed to try to save him, he died from his injuries on Sunday morning. Both officers were placed on administrative leave, pending further investigation.","auto_summary":"On November 22nd, 2014 Tamir E Rice was killed by a police officer at 1910 West Boulevard, Cleveland, OH 44102, USA.","source_original":"FatalEncounters.org, KilledByPolice.net","created":"2015-06-09T11:53:27.000Z","modified":"2015-09-09T16:31:23.000Z","victim":{"id":2083,"photo_thumb_url":"http:\/\/cdn.deadlyforce.info\/photos\/thumbs\/tamir-e-rice.jpg","gender":"Male","race":"African-American\/Black","showed_mental_illness_symptoms":false,"weapon":null,"armed":null,"name":"Tamir E Rice","cod":"Gunshot","mental_illness_symptoms":null,"photo_url":"http:\/\/cdn.deadlyforce.info\/photos\/tamir-e-rice.jpg","age":12,"created":"2015-06-09T11:53:27.000Z","modified":"2015-09-01T03:37:47.000Z"},"officer":{"id":2083,"race":null,"gender":null,"name":null,"age":null,"created":"2015-06-09T11:53:27.000Z","modified":"2015-07-13T17:28:28.000Z"},"agency":{"id":632,"formatted_address":"1150 West Washington Avenue, P.O.

James Warren Sr. had his pistol out and his hand on the front of Richard Haston's Jeep. Warren, a 29-year Martin County sheriff's veteran, had just been in an altercation with Haston, and told him to stop. Instead, Haston, 39, proceeded forward in the Jeep and struck Warren. Warren fired at least two shots from his .45 caliber handgun through the windshield, striking Haston in the upper torso.","auto_summary":"On June 7th, 2013 Richard Haston was killed by a police officer at 8913 Southeast Bridge Road, Hobe Sound, FL 33455, USA.","source_original":"FatalEncounters.org, KilledByPolice.net","created":"2015-06-16T05:31:51.000Z","modified":"2015-09-01T03:16:57.000Z","victim":{"id":3115,"photo_thumb_url":null,"gender":"Male","race":"European-American\/White","showed_mental_illness_symptoms":false,"weapon":"","armed":null,"name":"Richard Haston","cod":"Gunshot","mental_illness_symptoms":"","photo_url":null,"age":39,"created":"2015-06-16T05:31:51.000Z","modified":"2015-08-13T01:27:40.000Z"},"officer":{"id":3115,"race":"Unknown","gender":"Unknown","name":"","age":null,"created":"2015-06-16T05:31:51.000Z","modified":"2015-08-13T01:27:40.000Z"},"agency":{"id":3115,"formatted_address":"800 Southeast Monterey Road, Stuart, FL 34994, United States","website_url":"http:\/\/www.sheriff.martin.fl.us\/","phone":"(772) 220-7000","name":"Martin County sheriff's Office","email":null,"created":"2015-06-16T05:31:51.000Z","modified":"2015-08-13T01:27:40.000Z"},"location":{"formatted_address":"8913 Southeast Bridge Road, Hobe Sound, FL 33455, USA","address":"8913 Southeast Bridge Road","city":"Hobe Sound","county":"Martin County","coordinates":{"lon":"-80.1345513","lat":"27.0601634"},"accuracy":4,"id":3114,"state":"FL","postal_code":"33455"},"sources":[{"uid":"24a547dfa8656f1dfbcf770fce070a1d","id":2925,"title":"Man dead in Hobe Sound after deputy-involved shooting early Friday - TC Palm","excerpt":"","url":"http:\/\/www.tcpalm.com\/news\/man-dead-in-hobe-sound-after-deputy-involved"},{"uid":"e4d46307748d6bd80e6586bcf52d3813","id":13124,"title":"http:\/\/www.wptv.com\/news\/region-martin-county\/scooters-officer-involved-shooting-investigated-by-the-martin-county-sheriffs-office","excerpt":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.wptv.com\/news\/region-martin-county\/scooters-officer-involved-shooting-investigated-by-the-martin-county-sheriffs-office"}]},{"id":3119,"date":"2013-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","shots_fired":null,"description":"Barragan refused to pull over.

The officers were able to subdue O'Connor briefly with a Taser, but a struggle soon followed, as O'Connor fought the officers with his knife. An officer freed the aunt from the situation as it escalated, and one of the officers fired at O'Connor. According to the investigative report, O'Connor's family members described a history of mental illness that had intensified shortly before his death.","auto_summary":"On October 5th, 2012 Jeffrey Michael O'Connor was killed by a police officer at 6600 Park Avenue South, Minneapolis, MN 55423, USA.","source_original":"FatalEncounters.org","created":"2015-06-16T05:32:23.000Z","modified":"2015-09-09T16:12:21.000Z","victim":{"id":3431,"photo_thumb_url":"http:\/\/cdn.deadlyforce.info\/photos\/thumbs\/jeffrey-michael-oconnor.jpg","gender":"Male","race":"European-American\/White","showed_mental_illness_symptoms":true,"weapon":null,"armed":null,"name":"Jeffrey Michael O'Connor","cod":"Gunshot","mental_illness_symptoms":null,"photo_url":"http:\/\/cdn.deadlyforce.info\/photos\/jeffrey-michael-oconnor.jpg","age":25,"created":"2015-06-16T05:32:23.000Z","modified":"2015-09-01T03:40:48.000Z"},"officer":{"id":3431,"race":null,"gender":null,"name":null,"age":null,"created":"2015-06-16T05:32:23.000Z","modified":"2015-06-16T05:32:23.000Z"},"agency":{"id":3431,"formatted_address":"77 East Center, Richfield, UT, 84701\t","website_url":"http:\/\/www.ci.richfield.mn.us\/","phone":"(612) 861-9898","name":"Richfield Police Department","email":null,"created":"2015-06-16T05:32:23.000Z","modified":"2015-08-24T21:38:22.000Z"},"location":{"formatted_address":"6600 Park Avenue South, Minneapolis, MN 55423, USA","address":"6600 Park Avenue South","city":"Minneapolis","county":"Hennepin County","coordinates":{"lon":"-93.26579","lat":"44.8832809"},"accuracy":4,"id":6225,"state":"MN","postal_code":"55423"},"sources":[{"uid":"72a9c1e6da9bfcb6daf1d1d8a4b3dfc9","id":3217,"title":"Officer-involved shooting in Richfield","excerpt":"Richfield police at the scene of an officer-involved shooting.
